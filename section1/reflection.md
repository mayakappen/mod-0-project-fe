## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I tend to ask too soon sometimes, for example I reached out to Phil about a confusion that I cleared up myself before he was able to get back to me. I will try to be more specific in the future and try and troubleshoot myself.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
String - words or phrases that print from the console as written, surrounded by "" or ''
Numbers - any number, positive or negative or zero, decimals etc. can be used to perform functions
Boolean - true or false values
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
//for short phrases
/* */ for longer phrases
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is like a box that you can store things in. They could be any number of items or any kind of item.

Tinder:
String - names and bios

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
It is the combination of string phrases and information stored in variables to create phrases and display information

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
I tried to enter jk rowlings net worth as a number variable but it was too large to be used. how are numbers greater than 1 billion stored do they have to all be strings?
