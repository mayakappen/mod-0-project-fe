<h1> Array Methods </h1>
1. the pop() method removes the last piece of data in the array
  if formatted as console.log(arrayName.pop()); it prints what was removed
  if formatted as arrayName.pop(); it doesnt display anything, however if you proceed to enter console.log(arrayName); it will display the array with the last element removed.
2. the push() method will add pieces of data to end the array.
  you must specify what is being added within the parentheses
  you can add multiple pieces of data at one time by separating with commas.
3. similar to the pop() method, the shift() method removes the first piece of data from an array and returns that result
  if formatted as console.log(arrayName.shift()); it prints what was removed
  if formatted as arrayName.shift(); it doesnt display anything, however if you proceed to enter console.log(arrayName); it will display the array with the first element removed.
4. the unshift() method adds pieces of data to the beginning of the array and prints out the new length of the array
  can add multiple pieces of data at once with this method
  data is added in the exact order as it was entered by the user
