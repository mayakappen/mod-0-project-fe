## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

The part about S.M.A.R.T. goals; Setting Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals helps you to approach learning to code with clarity, focus, and use of appropriate strategies was helpful. Breaking down the goal of "learning to code" into smaller pieces is a great idea and also the growth mindset is very helpful to have, I can be very hard on myself and it is important to keep in mind that mistakes are part of learning and I shouldn't be afraid to make them as they can be learning opportunities.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I don't mind being new at things but I also tend to get comfortable sticking to familiar things once I get basic skills at something. It seems like once the novelty of a new thing has worn off its hard for me to keep pushing to improve, this is something I want to work on.


3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It wasn't too challenging as it was all stuff we had experienced before. I truly didn't mind and also googling or referring to older notes isn't too hard

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

For a daily life conditional my rule of not drinking coffee after 2 could apply. if time <= 2  I can have coffee, else if time > 2 i should drink water instead.

For an example from a web application; if you have a platform with some age restricted content, like steam for example, it could use a conditional statement to evaluate if the user is old enough to view the content. like if age is stored as a variable and age >= 18 then allow access to content, else if age < 18 it could display a message about the user not being old enough.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can add multiple conditions by adding "else if" on a following line of code with its own {} to contain other conditions. If the first if statement it will go down the list of "else if"s until it finds a statement that evaluates to true

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

As a developer we can use && to check if two conditions are met, and we can use || to check if 1 of 2 conditions are met before running a block of code.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I don't quite understand why == is bad to use
